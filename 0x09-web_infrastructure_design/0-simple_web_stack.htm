Explanation of the components:

Server: A physical or virtual machine that hosts the website and handles incoming requests.
Domain Name: A user-friendly name (e.g., foobar.com) used to access the website instead of remembering the server's IP address.
DNS Record: The DNS record for the domain name "www.foobar.com" is configured to point to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).
Web Server (Nginx): Receives incoming HTTP requests from the user's browser and serves web pages.
Application Server: Executes the application code to generate dynamic content based on user requests.
Application Files: Contains the codebase of the website's application logic and components.
Database (MySQL): Stores and manages the website's data, such as user information and content.
Communication: The server uses the HTTP protocol to communicate with the user's computer when serving the website.
Issues with this infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF): If the server fails, the website becomes inaccessible.
Downtime during Maintenance: Deploying new code or performing maintenance requires restarting the web server, resulting in temporary downtime.
Scalability: With a single server, it may not handle high incoming traffic, potentially leading to performance issues or website unavailability.
